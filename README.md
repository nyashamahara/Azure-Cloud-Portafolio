### **🔧 Topics Covered**  
`Virtual Machines` | `RBAC` | `Azure AD` | `Policies` | `Encryption` | `Cost Management`  
### **Scenario**

A company wants to deploy a virtual machine for their web application, secure it with role-based access control, enforce a policy for naming conventions, encrypt sensitive data, and monitor the cost of the deployed resources.

### **📝 Summary**  
This project involves deploying a virtual machine, securing it using RBAC, applying Azure Policies for resource governance, encrypting sensitive data, and monitoring costs. It teaches foundational concepts for managing Azure identities, governance, and compute resources.
